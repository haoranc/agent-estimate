# Research

> Based on a real task from a production multi-agent workflow.

## Command

```bash
agent-estimate estimate \
  "Audit cloud infrastructure providers for production deployment" \
  --type research
```

## Output

### Per-Task Estimates

| Task | Model | Tier | Agent | Base PERT (O/M/P) | Modifiers | Effective Duration | Human Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Audit cloud infrastructure providers for production deploym…** | research | S | Claude | 10m / 20m / 30m (E=20m) | spec 1.00 x warm 1.00 x fit 1.00 = 1.00 | 20m | 56.6m |

### Wave Plan

| Wave | Tasks | Duration | Agent Assignments (amortized review) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Audit cloud infrastructure providers for production deploym… | 38m | Claude: Audit cloud infrastructure providers for production deploym… +15m review |

### Timeline Summary

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Best case | 27.1m |
| Expected case | 38m |
| Worst case | 48.9m |
| Human-speed equivalent | 56.6m |
| Compression ratio | 1.49x |
| Review overhead (per-task, pre-amortization) | 15m |

### Review Overhead

Review is amortized per agent per wave: one review cycle covers all PRs from that
agent in the wave.  Per-task values below are the naive (pre-amortization) figures.

| Task | Review Overhead |
| --- | --- |
| Audit cloud infrastructure providers for production deploym… | 15m |
| **Total (naive)** | **15m** |

### Agent Load Summary

| Agent | Task Count | Total Work | Estimated Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 1 | 23m | $0.55 |
| Codex | 0 | 0m | $0.00 |
| Gemini | 0 | 0m | $0.00 |

### Critical Path

**Audit cloud infrastructure providers for production deploym…**

### Assumptions

- CLI task descriptions carry no dependency edges; scheduling assumes independence.
- Calibration store: n=0 observations applied; the estimate pipeline does not consume calibration feedback.
- Bundled-prior thinking-level baseline: Claude Code high and Codex extra-high.
- Human equivalent covers agent work only; human review is reported separately.
- Cost is a heuristic that assumes one agent turn per 5 minutes of work.

### Tier Corrections

No tier corrections.

### Reliability Horizon Warnings

No reliability horizon warnings.


## What actually happened

| Metric | Estimated | Actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent | Claude | Claude |
| Duration | 38m expected | ~15m |
| Outcome | — | 12-section report, 7 providers evaluated, recommended hybrid deployment |
| Quality | — | Q4 (strong) |

The agent finished well under the estimate — research tasks with web access tend to run fast because agents scan documentation and pricing pages in parallel. The actual landed below even the best case (27m). This is typical for research: high variance, but the wins are dramatic.

## Key takeaway

Research tasks use the generic human-multiplier range (2.0-4.0x) while the research model handles the agent-side time box. Pattern matching across large datasets is still tedious for humans but routine for agents: scanning 7 cloud providers' pricing, compliance, and feature matrices would take a human most of a workday. Use `--type research` to select the research estimation model — it preserves the research-specific PERT shape while scaling it with the same scope signals used by other task types.
