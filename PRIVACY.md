# Privacy Policy

**agent-estimate** is an open-source CLI tool that runs entirely on your local machine.

## Data Collection

This plugin does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, telemetry, or usage analytics.

## Local Operation

All estimation calculations, calibration data, and wave planning run locally. No data is sent to external servers by this tool.

## Optional GitHub Integration

When using the `--issues` flag, the tool makes read-only requests to the GitHub API to fetch issue metadata. These requests go directly from your machine to GitHub using your locally configured credentials (`gh` CLI). No data is proxied through any intermediary.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
